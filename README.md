Primite 1.03 – Artificial Cognition System,  JN Research (Dubai, UAE)
This repository contains supporting material for Primite 1.03, an artificial cognitive system built using Adaptrons - artificial neurons that exhibit:
•	Subthreshold potentials
•	Graded potentials
•	Action potentials
Unlike machine learning models, Adaptrons operate on principled neuron-like rules and adapt internally and with each other. From these dynamics, higher cognitive functions emerge naturally.

What’s New in Primite 1.03?
Primite 1.03 (1,800 Adaptrons) demonstrates:
•	Autonomous Sleep States: system enters sleep without inputs.
•	Dreams: generates internal outputs during sleep; some remain internal, others are shared as external “dreams.”
•	Original Thought: outputs never given as stimuli emerge autonomously.
•	Memory Formation & Recall: memories of stimuli and self-generated thoughts, recalled across short, intermediate, and long-term spans.
•	Anticipation: outputs appear before the corresponding input stimulus is presented.

Reports & Outputs:
•	Technical Report: Primite 1.03 (PDF)
•	Experimental Outputs (Timestamped)
•	Prior Report: Primite 1.02 (Memory & Original Thought)
All outputs are raw and timestamped  for independent verification.

Methodology Overview:
•	No machine learning or gradient descent.
•	Only fundamental neuron-like rules are preprogrammed.
•	Behavior emerges from interactions and genetic parameters (configurations controlling adaptability).
•	One control experiment set system as a pure input-output machine → no higher functions emerged, confirming adaptability is key.

Live Demos:
We are open to external verification via live demos: reviewers choose inputs, observe outputs in real time, and confirm activity. For deeper reviews (e.g., genetic parameters), NDAs may be required.

How to Use This Repo:
•	Browse reports/ for detailed technical documentation.
•	Explore outputs/ for raw timestamped results.

About JN Research:
JN Research is pioneering Adaptronics - a new substrate for artificial cognition that is neither mechanistic neuroscience nor it is traditional AI, using Principle-first approach. Our systems show early signs of higher cognitive functions, memory, and creativity, moving beyond today’s statistical AI toward scalable machine cognition.
